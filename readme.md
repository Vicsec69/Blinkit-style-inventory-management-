Quick-Commerce Grocery Demand Forecasting
📌 Description

This project builds an end-to-end demand forecasting system for a quick-commerce (Blinkit-style) grocery platform. Using historical sales data, the system predicts short-term product demand to support inventory planning, reduce stock-outs, and minimize wastage.

The project applies time-series analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to generate interpretable demand forecasts and visual insights suitable for business decision-making.
